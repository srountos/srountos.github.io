    <h2>Be Polite</h2>
    <p>Let us first recall what we value at our school:</p>
    <blockquote>We, the community of Joel Barlow High School, believe in a rigorous, dynamic education that respects the diversity of student aspirations.  Through an open and active exchange of ideas, we seek to promote values, knowledge, and skills that foster meaningful inquiry, personal integrity, individual well-being, global citizenship, and continuous independent learning. </blockquote>
    <p>We expect all of our students to know how to act while having an &quot;open and active exchange of ideas&quot; in person. The expectation for online exchanges is no different. If you would hesitate to direct a comment to another student in-person, then you should also refrain from posting, texting or sharing that comment virtually. It is part of our global citizenship and personal integrity to always respect others whether you are communicating in person, or via the Internet.</p>
    <h2>Be Respectful</h2>
    <p> Just because you share information online doesn't mean everyone else is comfortable doing so. When using social media, it is important to be mindful of the fact that different people share different amounts of details. While one student may be comfortable sharing their birthday and other personal information, another student may only want close friends and family to know this information. Before posting comments via social media, ask yourself what potentially private information of others you may be sharing. Respect the privacy preferences of your peers. </p>
    <h2>Think twice (and maybe even three times!) before pressing send</h2>
    <p>It is important to remember that the Internet is a giant, virtual library of content. As soon as you hit enter or press send, information officially becomes out of your control and available for all to seeâ€¦ for all time. A good rule of thumb is to consider  &quot;If someone printed out what I typed, would I be proud to admit to it?&quot; before you submit anything via the web. Some students prefer to ask themselves &quot;Would my parent or guardian be pleased if they saw this?&quot;. If the answer to any of these questions is no, you should rethink sending or posting that piece of information.</p>
